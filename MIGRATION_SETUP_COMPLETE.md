# Migration Setup Complete! 🎉

Your sincap-common project has been successfully migrated from GORM to sqlx with Goose migrations.

## What's Been Set Up

### ✅ **Goose Migration System**
- **Goose v3** installed and configured
- **Makefile** with convenient migration commands
- **Configuration file** (`goose.yaml`) for easy setup
- **Example migration** demonstrating the format
- **Comprehensive documentation** in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

### ✅ **Dependencies Updated**
- ❌ Removed: `gorm.io/gorm` and related GORM packages
- ✅ Added: `github.com/pressly/goose/v3` for migrations
- ✅ Kept: `github.com/jmoiron/sqlx` for database operations
- ✅ Updated: `zapgorm` package to work with sqlx (no more GORM dependencies)

### ✅ **Migration Infrastructure**
- `migrations/` directory created
- Example SQL migration file
- README with usage instructions
- Makefile with common commands

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Goose CLI

```bash
# Install Goose globally
make install-goose

# Or manually
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

### 2. Configure Your Database

Set environment variables:

```bash
export GOOSE_DRIVER=mysql
export GOOSE_DBSTRING="user:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/database?parseTime=true"
```

Or edit `goose.yaml` with your database connection details.

### 3. Create Your First Migration

```bash
# Create a SQL migration
make create-migration NAME=create_products_table

# Create a Go migration (for complex data operations)
make create-go-migration NAME=migrate_product_data
```

### 4. Apply Migrations

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
make migrate-up

# Check migration status
make migrate-status
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make install-goose` | Install Goose CLI tool |
| `make create-migration NAME=xxx` | Create new SQL migration |
| `make create-go-migration NAME=xxx` | Create new Go migration |
| `make migrate-up` | Apply all pending migrations |
| `make migrate-down` | Rollback last migration |
| `make migrate-status` | Show migration status |
| `make migrate-version` | Show current version |
| `make migrate-validate` | Validate migrations |
| `make help` | Show all available commands |

## Migration from GORM AutoMigrate

### For Existing Projects

If you have existing tables created by GORM AutoMigrate:

1. **Create initial migration** representing your current schema:
   ```bash
   make create-migration NAME=initial_schema
   ```

2. **Edit the migration file** to match your existing database schema

3. **Mark as applied** (if tables already exist):
   ```bash
   # This tells Goose the migration is already applied
   goose -dir ./migrations up-by-one --no-versioning
   ```

4. **Future changes** should be done through migrations:
   ```bash
   make create-migration NAME=add_user_status_column
   ```

### For New Projects

Simply start creating migrations for your schema:

```bash
make create-migration NAME=create_users_table
make create-migration NAME=create_products_table
```

## Key Benefits of This Setup
